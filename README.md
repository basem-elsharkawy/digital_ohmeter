# digital_ohmeter
Arduino-based Digital Ohm Meter that measures resistor values using ADC and displays results on a 0.96" OLED via Adafruit SSD1306 &amp; GFX libraries. Converts analog readings to voltage, calculates resistance with a reference resistor, and shows the value in real time with clear visuals.
